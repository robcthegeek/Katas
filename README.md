# To-Do

- [ ] Create `Game` Model to Create "Shell"
    - [x] 2 Players
    - [x] Board (8x8)
    - [x] `Start` (Sets Players to Colours)
- [ ] Flesh Out Models
    - [x] Player Name
    - [x] Board Size
    - [ ] Square Colours


> Turns out there's a proper [Checkers Notation](http://www.bobnewell.net/nucleus/checkers.php?itemid=289) which makes a lot more sense - you can't land on the white squares, so only reference the black ones!

> Simply put, _black_ squares are referenced from 1-32, starting from bottom-left going to top-left _from the perspective of the player_.
