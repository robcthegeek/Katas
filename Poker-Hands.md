## You Can't Read My Poker Face üòê

It's time to get some casino vibes going! üí∞üí∏

1. **Create a 'hand'** (5 cards) from a [standard 52-card deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck#Rank_and_color) (no Jokers).
1. **Determine the rank of a hand** from the [Poker Hand Rankings](https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings).
1. **Add a second player** - your opponent, and deal a hand for them. **Ensure you take the remaining cards from the deck.** (You shouldn't have any duplicates across hands).
1. **Determine if your hand beats your opponents** and output the winner.
1. **Add some pokers faces!** Emoji, to represent a player - and their confidence. For example:
    * A 'confidence' of '1' might indicate "you can't read this poker face".
    * When creating your opponent, you randomly select a confidence value.
    * When hands are dealt, their face pops up - are they bluffing?
    * **Add the ability to 'call' or 'fold'** If you call and beat their hand, you win! (Otherwise you lose)


## Bonus Round(s)

* Add multiple opponents to the table - up to 9 (10 players max).
* Assume that if you correctly call/fold each player, you win the round. How many rounds can you go?
* Add a bankroll to act as your 'life' - each 'won' round gets you $50, entering a round costs $10.
